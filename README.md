Overview of the algorithms / paper:

- The identification of "dominant balances" (see Callaham et al., 2021, Nat. Comms) of two or more equation terms often yields physical insight because dominant balances often arise in nonlinear dynamical systems.
- Automated dominant balance discovery requires hyperparameter tuning (not addressed by Callaham et al., 2021, Nat. Comms).
- We present a robust objective criterion for dominant balance identification that guides hyperparameter tuning, enabling automated dominant balance discovery where the "correct" balances are not known a priori.
